# Local data {background-color="#008980" style="text-align: center"}

*Robert Schlegel*

```{r tidy-3-opts, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE
)
```

## Problem

-   Now that we can access data, how do we manage them?
-   Are there tools to help us with this?
-   How can we perform more complex analyses?

## Solution

-   We will go more in depth into advanced workflows
-   The most commonly used tools are discussed
-   A few examples of applied statistics are provided

## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # All-in-one
```

## Expand

## Applied statistics

<!-- Perform an ANOVA and show how to filter out non-significant results -->
